(* ###################################################################### *)
(** ** The [auto] and [eauto] Tactics *)

(** The [auto] tactic solves goals that are solvable by any combination of 
     - [intros]
     - [apply] (with a local hypothesis, by default)
     - [reflexivity]
       
    The [eauto] tactic works just like [auto], except that it uses
    [eapply] instead of [apply]. *)

(** Using [auto] is always "safe" in the sense that it will never fail
    and will never change the proof state: either it completely solves
    the current goal, or it does nothing.

    Here is a contrived example: *)

Lemma auto_example_1 : forall P Q R S T U : Prop,
  (P -> Q) ->
  (P -> R) ->
  (T -> R) ->
  (S -> T -> U) ->
  ((P->Q) -> (P->S)) ->
  T ->
  P ->
  U.
Proof.
 auto.  Qed.

(** By default, [auto] and [eauto] consider just the hypotheses in the
    current context.  But we can also give a list of lemmas and
    constructors to consider in addition to these, by writing [auto
    using ...]. *)

Lemma auto_example_2 : forall P Q R : Prop,
  Q ->
  (Q -> R) ->
  P \/ (Q /\ R).
Proof.
  auto using conj, or_introl, or_intror.  Qed.

(** There are some constructors and lemmas that are applied very often
    in proofs.  We can tell [auto] to _always_ consider these, instead
    of mentioning them explicitly each time.  This is accomplished by
    writing
[[
      Hint Resolve l.
]]
    at the top level, where [l] is a top-level lemma theorem or a
    constructor of an inductively defined proposition (i.e., anything
    whose type is an implication).  As a shorthand, we can write
[[
      Hint Constructors c.
]]
    to tell Coq to add _all_ of the constructors from the inductive
    definition of [c] to the database used by [auto].

    It is also sometimes necessary to add
[[
      Hint Unfold d.
]]
    where [d] is a defined symbol, so that [auto] knows to expand
    uses of [d] and enable further possibilities for applying
    lemmas that it knows about.  *)

(** Here are some [Hint]s we will find useful.  There is an example of
    the effect of the [and] and [or] hints below. *)
Hint Constructors and.
Hint Constructors or.

Hint Constructors refl_step_closure.
Hint Resolve beq_id_eq beq_id_false_not_eq.

Lemma auto_example_3 : forall P Q R : Prop,
  Q ->
  (Q -> R) ->
  P \/ (Q /\ R).
Proof.
  auto.  Qed.

(** Warning: Just as with Coq's other automation facilities, it is
    easy to overuse [auto] and [eauto] and wind up with proofs that
    are impossible to understand later! 

    Also, overuse of [eauto] can make proof scripts very slow.  Get in
    the habit of using [auto] most of the time and [eauto] more
    sparingly. *)

(* ###################################################################### *)
(** ** The [Proof with] Tactic *)

(** If you start a proof with [Proof with (tactic)] then writing [...]
     instead of [.] after a tactic in the body of the proof will try
     to solve all generated subgoals with [tactic] (and fail if this
     doesn't work).

     One common use of this facility is "[Proof with auto]" (or
     [eauto]).  We'll see many examples of this later in the file. *)

(* ###################################################################### *)
(** ** The [solve by inversion] Tactic *)

(** Here's another nice automation feature: it often arises that the
    context contains a contradictory assumption and we want to use
    [inversion] on it to solve the goal.  We'd like to be able to say
    to Coq, "find a contradictory assumption and invert it" without
    giving its name explicitly.

    Unfortunately, Coq does not provide a built-in tactic that does
    this.  However, it is not too hard to define one
    ourselves.  (Thanks to Aaron Bohannon for this nice hack.) *)

Tactic Notation "solve_by_inversion_step" tactic(t) :=  
  match goal with  
  | H : _ |- _ => solve [ inversion H; subst; t ] 
  end
  || fail "because the goal is not solvable by inversion.".

Tactic Notation "solve" "by" "inversion" "1" :=
  solve_by_inversion_step idtac.
Tactic Notation "solve" "by" "inversion" "2" :=
  solve_by_inversion_step (solve by inversion 1).
Tactic Notation "solve" "by" "inversion" "3" :=
  solve_by_inversion_step (solve by inversion 2).
Tactic Notation "solve" "by" "inversion" :=
  solve by inversion 1.

(** Again, the details of how the [Tactic Notation] definition works
    are not important.  All we need to know is that doing [solve by
    inversion] will find a hypothesis that can be inverted to solve
    the goal, if there is one.  The tactics [solve by inversion 2] and
    [solve by inversion 3] are slightly fancier versions which will
    perform two or three inversions in a row, if necessary, to solve
    the goal. *)

(* ###################################################################### *)
(** ** The [try solve] Tactic *)

(** If [t] is a tactic, then [try solve [t]] is a tactic that
      - if [t] solves the goal, behaves just like [t], or
      - if [t] cannot completely solve the goal, does
        nothing.

    More generally, [try solve [t1 | t2 | ...]] will try to solve the
    goal by using [t1], [t2], etc.  If none of them succeeds in
    completely solving the goal, then [try solve [t1 | t2 | ...]] does
    nothing.

    The fact that it does nothing when it doesn't completely succeed
    in solving the goal means that there is no harm in using [try
    solve T] in situations where [T] might actually make no sense.  In
    particular, if we put it after a [;] it will solve as many
    subgoals as it can and leave the rest for us to solve by other
    methods.  It will _not_ leave any of the subgoals in a mangled
    state. *)

(* ###################################################################### *)
(** ** The [f_equal] Tactic *)

(** This tactic replaces the goal [f x1 x2 ... xn = f y1 y2 ... yn] with
   the subgoals [x1 = y1], [x2=y2],...,[xn=yn].  It is useful for avoiding
   explicit rewriting steps, and often the generated subgoals can be quickly
   cleared by [auto]. *)

(* ###################################################################### *)
(** ** The [normalize] Tactic *)

(** When experimenting when the languages defined in this file, we
    will sometimes want to see what a particular concrete term steps
    to, so we want to solve goals of the form [ t -->* t' ] where
    [t] is a completely concrete term.  These proofs are simple but
    repetitive. Consider for example reducing an arithmetic expression
    using the small-step relation [astep] defined in the previous
    chapter: *)

Definition astep_many st := refl_step_closure (astep st).

  apply rsc_step with (ANum 15).
    apply AS_Plus.
  apply rsc_refl.

(** We repeatedly applied [rsc_step] until we got to a normal form. The proofs that 
    the intermediate steps are possible are simple enough that [auto], with
    appropriate hints, can solve them. *)

(** The following custom Ltac captures this pattern.  In addition,

    user can follow how the term is being evaluated. *)

(** ** Normal Forms and Values *)

(** The first interesting thing about the [step] relation is that the
    progress theorem as we stated it before fails!  That is, there are
    terms that are normal forms (they can't take a step) but not
    values -- i.e., we have not included them in our definition of
    possible "results of evaluation."  Such terms are said to be
    stuck. *)

    an induction to reason about a term that is known to be a numeric

    itself or over the evidence that it is a numeric value.  The proof
    goes through in either case, but you will find that one way is
    quite a bit shorter than the other.  For the sake of the exercise,
    try to complete the proof both ways. *)

(** * The Simply Typed Lambda-Calculus *)

(** The simply typed lambda-calculus (STLC) can be described as the
    simplest possible functional programming language -- it contains
    anonymous functions, application, variables, and nothing else.

    Since it is essentially a small fragment of Coq's built-in
    functional language, we could informally use the same
    notation for programs.  For example,
[[
          fun x:A => x
]]
    is the identity function at the type [A], and
[[
          fun x:A => fun y:B => x
]]
    is a function that takes an argument of type [A], throws it
    away, and returns the constant-[x] function (of type [B->A]).

    However, this "[fun ... => ...]" notation is a little heavy,
    especially for writing on the blackboard.  So when we discuss
    terms informally, we'll use another common way of writing function
    abstractions in this language: [\x:A.x], where [\] stands for the
    greek letter "lambda".  

    
    To keep things simple, we'll start with the _pure_ simply typed
    lambda-calculus, where base types like [A], [B], etc. are
    completely uninterpreted -- i.e., there are no constants belonging
    to base types and no primitive operations over base types.  At the
    end of the chapter, we'll see how to extend the pure system to
    something closer to a real programming language by adding base
    types like numbers.

    The main new technical issues that we'll have to face in this
    section are dealing with _variable binding_ and _substitution_.

    - We've already seen how to formalize a language with
      variables (Imp).  There, however, the variables were all global.
      In STLC, we need to handle _bound_ variables because of function
      parameters.

    - Moreover, instead of just looking up global variables in
      the store, we'll need to reduce function applications by
      substituting arguments for parameters in function
      bodies.

(* ################################### *)
(** *** Types *)

(** The function types of the STLC are just like the function types of
    Coq.  We begin with a collection of base types, which we write
    [A], [B], etc., in informal examples (formally, they are
    designated by the constructor [ty_base] together with an [id]).
    Then, for every pair of types [T1] and [T2], we construct the
    arrow type [T1->T2] (formally, [ty_arrow T1 T2]). *)

  | tm_abs : id -> ty -> tm -> tm.

(** One important thing to note here is that an abstraction
    [\x:T.t] (formally, [tm_abs x T t]) is always annotated with the
    type ([T]) of its parameter.  This is in contrast to Coq (and
    other functional languages like ML, Haskell, etc.), where we can
    write either
[[
      fun x : A => t
]]
    or
[[
      fun x => t
]]
    and trust Coq to fill in an appropriate annotation in the latter
    case.

(** (We make these Notations rather than Definitions to make things

(* ################################### *)
(** *** Values *)

(** When we come to defining the values of the STLC, we have to
    think a little.

    First, an application is clearly _not_ a value: It represents a
    function being invoked on some argument, and the term cannot be
    finished computing till this invocation has actually happened.

    For abstractions, on the other hand, we have a choice:

      - We can say that [\a:A.t] is a value only if [t] is a
        value -- i.e., only if the function's body has been
        reduced (as much as it can be without knowing what
        argument it is going to be applied to).

      - Or we can say that [\a:A.t] is always a value, no matter
        whether [t] is one or not -- in other words, we can say
        that reduction stops at abstractions.  

    Coq makes the first choice -- for example,
[[
         Eval simpl in (fun a:bool => plus 3 4)
]]
    yields [fun a:bool => 7].  But most real functional
    programming languages make the second choice -- reduction of
    a function's body only begins when the function is actually
    applied to an argument.  We also make the latter choice here.

    Having decided this, we don't need to worry about whether
    variables are values, since we'll always be reducing programs
    "from the outside in," and that means the [step] relation
    will always be working with closed terms (ones with no free
    variables).  *)

(* ################################### *)
(** *** Substitution *)

(** Now we come to the most interesting part of the definition:
    the operation of substituting one term for the free
    occurrences of some variable in another term.  This operation
    will be used in a moment to define the operational semantics
    of function application, where we will need to substitute the
    argument term for the function parameter in the function's
    body.
    
    Informally, substitution is often written [[s/x]t],
    pronounced "substitute [s] for [x] in [t]".

    For example:
[[
      [(\b:A.b)/a]a = \b:A.b

      [(\b:A.b)/a]c = c
      
      [(\b:A.b)/a](\c:B. a) = \c:B. \b:A.b

      [(\b:A.b)/a](\c:(A->A)->(A->A). c a) 
        = \c:(A->A)->(A->A). c (\b:A.b)

      [(\b:A.b)/a](\a:B.a) = \a:B.a

      [(\b:(B->B)->(B->B).b)/a](a (\a:B.a)) 
        = (\b:(B->B)->(B->B).b) (\a:B.a)
]]
    Note that, in the last two examples, we do _not_ substitute
    for the [a] in the body of an abstraction whose bound
    variable is named [a].

    Here is the formal definition:*)
*)

fun subst :: "id \<Rightarrow> ltm \<Rightarrow> ltm \<Rightarrow> ltm" where
"subst x s (ltm_var x') = (if x=x' then s else (ltm_var x'))" |
"subst x s (ltm_abs x' T t) = ltm_abs x' T (if x=x' then t else (subst x s t))" |
"subst x s (ltm_app t t') = ltm_app (subst x s t) (subst x s t')"  

(* 
Fixpoint subst (x:id) (s:tm) (t:tm) : tm :=
  match t with
  | tm_var x' => if beq_id x x' then s else t
  | tm_abs x' T t1 => tm_abs x' T (if beq_id x x' then t1 else (subst x s t1)) 
  | tm_app t1 t2 => tm_app (subst x s t1) (subst x s t2)
  end.

(** Technical note: Substitution becomes trickier to define if we
    consider the case where [s], the term being substituted in, may
    itself contain free variables.  Since we are only interested in
    defining the [step] relation on closed terms here, we can avoid
    this extra complexity. *)

(* ################################### *)
(** *** Reduction *)

(** The small-step reduction relation for STLC follows the same
    pattern as the ones we have seen before.  Intuitively, to
    reduce a function application, we first reduce its left-hand
    side until it becomes a literal function; then we reduce its
    right-hand side (the argument) until it is also a value; and
    finally we substitute the argument for the bound variable in
    the body of the function.  This last rule, written informally
    as
[[
      (\a:T.t12) v2 --> [v2/a]t12
]]
    is traditionally called "beta-reduction".

    Informally:

(** Question: What is the type of the term "[x y]"?

    Answer: It depends on the types of [x] and [y]!  

    I.e., in order to assign a type to a term, we need to know
    what assumptions we should make about the types of its free
    variables.

    This leads us to a three-place "typing judgment", informally
    written [Gamma |- t : T], where [Gamma] is a "typing context"
    -- a mapping from variables to their types.  *)

Theorem progress : forall t T, 
     has_type empty t T ->
     value t \/ exists t', t --> t'.
Proof with eauto.
  intros t T Ht.
  remember (@empty ty) as Gamma.
  (typing_cases (induction Ht) Case); subst Gamma...
  Case "T_Var".
    inversion H. 

  Case "T_App".
    right. destruct IHHt1...

    SCase "t1 is a value".
      destruct IHHt2...
      SSCase "t2 is a value".
        (* Since t2 is a value and has an arrow type, it must be an abs.
           Sometimes this is proved separately and called a "canonical 
           forms" lemma *)
        inversion H; subst. exists (subst x t2 t)...
      SSCase "t2 steps".
        destruct H0 as [t2' Hstp]. exists (tm_app t1 t2')...

    SCase "t1 steps".
      destruct H as [t1' Hstp]. exists (tm_app t1' t2)...
Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, optional *)
(** Show that progress can also be proved by induction on terms
    instead of types. *)

Theorem progress' : forall t T,
     has_type empty t T ->
     value t \/ exists t', t --> t'.
Proof.
  intros t.

(** *** Uniqueness of types *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars *)
(** Another pleasant property of the STLC is that types are
    unique: a given term (in a given context) has at most one
    type. *)

(** Without peeking, write down the progress and preservation
    theorems for the simply typed lambda-calculus. *)
(** [] *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars (stlc_variation1) *)
(** Suppose we add the following new rule to the evaluation
    relation of the STLC:
[[
      | T_Strange : forall x t,  
           has_type empty (tm_abs x A t) B
]]
    Which of the following properties of the STLC remain true in
    the presence of this rule?  For each one, write either
    "remains true" or else "becomes false." If a property becomes
    false, give a counterexample.

      - Determinacy of [step]

      - Progress

      - Preservation

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars (stlc_variation2) *)
(** Suppose we remove the rule [ST_App1] from the [step]
    relation. Which of the three properties in the previous
    exercise become false in the absence of this rule? For each
    that becomes false, give a counterexample.

(** * Exercise: STLC with Arithmetic *) 

(** To see how the STLC might function as the core of a real
    programming language, let's extend it with a concrete base
    type of numbers and some constants and primitive
    operators. *)

Module STLCArith.

(** ** Syntax and operational semantics *)

(** To types, we add a base type of natural numbers (and remove
    the other base types, for brevity) *)

Inductive ty : Type :=
  | ty_arrow : ty -> ty -> ty
  | ty_nat   : ty.

(** To terms, we add natural number constants, along with
    successor, predecessor, and zero-testing... *)

Inductive tm : Type :=
  | tm_var : id -> tm
  | tm_app : tm -> tm -> tm
  | tm_abs : id -> ty -> tm -> tm
  | tm_nat  : nat -> tm
  | tm_succ : tm -> tm
  | tm_pred : tm -> tm
  | tm_mult : tm -> tm -> tm
  | tm_if0  : tm -> tm -> tm -> tm.

Tactic Notation "tm_cases" tactic(first) tactic(c) :=
  first;
  [ c "tm_var" | c "tm_app" | c "tm_abs" |
    c "tm_nat" | c "tm_succ" | c "tm_pred" | c "tm_mult" | c "tm_if0" ].

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars (STLCArith) *)
(** Finish formalizing the definition and properties of the STLC extended
    with arithmetic.  Specifically:

    - Copy the whole development of STLC that we went through above (from
      the definition of values through the Progress theorem), and
      paste it into the file at this point.

    - Extend the definitions of the [subst] operation and the [step]
      relation to include appropriate clauses for the arithmetic operators.

    - Extend the proofs of all the properties of the original STLC to deal
      with the new syntactic forms.  Make sure Coq accepts the whole file. *)
